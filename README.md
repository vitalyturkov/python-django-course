Here, have some bydlocode

Ok, so It seems there are still some issues, but idk if those are because of my bad code or because of the fact, that hotline prevents me to send such a big amount of requests in such a little period of time (not sure hotline does it at all).

to run use: scrapy crawl spidr -o results.json

Achtung! Output json file will contain code representation of cyrillic symbols instead of symbols itself. Use any of those online json viewers/formatters to view and navigate comfortably (there're plenty of those, google for it).
